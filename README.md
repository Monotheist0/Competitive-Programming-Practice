# Competitive Programming Practice

Now documenting everything properly i guess?

## üìÅ Structure

- `Codeforces/` - Codeforces problems
- `Practice/` - Random practice problems

## üéØ What I Know (Rusty but There)

**Comfortable with:**
- Two pointers, Two Sum / Three Sum / Four Sum variations
- Basic implementation problems

**Learned but need refreshing:**
- Graphs: BFS, DFS, Dijkstra, Topological Sort
- Sorting: Merge Sort, Quick Sort
- DP: Knapsack variants
- Everything from a typical CSE course (but most forgotten)

## üìù Roadmap

Rebuilding systematically. 

### Phase 1: Core Fundamentals
- [x] Arrays & Strings basics
- [x] Two pointers
- [ ] Sliding window
- [ ] Prefix sums
- [ ] Binary search

### Phase 2: Data Structures
- [ ] Stack & Queue problems
- [ ] Linked List manipulation
- [ ] Trees (traversals, basic problems)
- [ ] Heaps / Priority Queue
- [x] Hash Maps / Sets

### Phase 3: Sorting & Searching
- [ ] Merge sort implementation
- [ ] Quick sort implementation
- [ ] Binary search variants
- [ ] Sorting applications

### Phase 4: Graph Algorithms
- [ ] BFS implementation & problems
- [ ] DFS implementation & problems
- [ ] Shortest path (Dijkstra, Bellman-Ford)
- [ ] Topological sort
- [ ] Union-Find / DSU
- [ ] Minimum Spanning Tree

### Phase 5: Dynamic Programming
- [ ] 1D DP (Fibonacci, House Robber)
- [ ] 2D DP (Grid problems, LCS)
- [ ] Knapsack variants (0/1, unbounded, bounded)
- [ ] DP on subsequences
- [ ] DP on trees
- [ ] State machine DP

### Phase 6: Advanced Topics
- [ ] Segment Trees
- [ ] Fenwick Tree (BIT)
- [ ] Trie
- [ ] Advanced DP patterns
- [ ] Number theory basics
- [ ] Game theory

## üîÑ Current Focus

Refreshing graph algorithms (BFS, DFS) and rebuilding DP intuition.

## üí≠ Philosophy

Not here to speedrun. Just solving consistently, understanding deeply, documenting clearly.
